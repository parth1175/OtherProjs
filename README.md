# Side Projects / Presentations

RecoverVision: Side project
 - Rather radical and miscellaneous project that stemmed from my childhood hatred for wearing glasses
 Did a lot of research and spent a lot of time on it (time span 1-2 years). However, after taking entrepreneurship classes in college and doing some self-pondering, I found the project had zero scope and I did not have enough interest in the idea to pursue further
